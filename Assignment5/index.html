      <p>We used the sf_crime.geojson as a dataset in order to visualize the crimes in San Francisco. </br>
      A heatmap is used to depict the intensity of data at geographical points so we chose to use it to visualize the areas prone to crimes. 
      Since we have the coordinates, each crime represents a data point on a map. The heatmap colors are dynamically scaled according to the greatest concentration of points. Areas of higher intensity are colored red, and areas of lower intensity appear green. </br>
      Change radius button modifies the radius of influence for each data point to be lower than the default value. At a lower intensity, it can be clearly noted that the NE of San Francisco is the most targeted area regarding crimes.

        <p>As can be seen from our line graph below, we found out that between the times of 3 AM to 6 AM, the least number of crimes were committed and
            between the times of 3 PM to 6 PM, the most number of crimes were committed. We can, perhaps, attribute this to to 1500-1800 hours being the interval
            in which most people return home from work and the interval of 0300-0600 hours being where most people are home.

        <p>As can be seen from our bar graph, it appears that the most number of crimes committed were Theft/Larceny with a bit less than 20% of total crimes committed in the period.
