        <li>Description of the dataset</li>
        <p>
            In order to do this assignment, there were 2 datasets that were used. 
            The 1st dataset is a 112-dimensional dataset with 40 data points in it where each of the 40 rows represent the outline of a hand. The 2nd dataset used is the 112-dimensional dataset that is obtained by performing PCA on the hand set. By reducing the number of dimenssions, an clear analysis could be performed and visualization done to emphasize the difference betweeh hands outline. The aim is to use PCA to observe the variation between hands.
        </p>
        <li>Description of PCA</li>
        <p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to perform linear data reduction for the purpose of data visualisation.
        </p>
        <li>Visualiaztion Methods</li>
        <p>We used D3 in order to visualize the given data from the CSV files. In order to have a nice interactivity
            between the PCA scatter on the right and the show of the hand on the left site, there were Click and mous
            over events introduced. As soon as a point in the scatter is clicked, the corresponding hand is drawn. In
            order to see, which dataset is displayed, the User can see the Hand number on hovering the point in the
            scatter.</p>
        <li>Conclusion</li>
        <p>
        	The 40 hands in the 112-dimensional space vary based on size and shape. While the sets of data can't provide much information without data visualization, our plots ensure to see the connection between a PC and its associated hand outline. The difference between hands can be clearly seen when clicking on different scattered points. For example, <font id="outlier26" color="#ff7f50">hand no 26</font> has the smallest distance between the thumb and the little finger compared to <font id="outlier31" color="#ff7f50">hand no 31</font> which has the 2 fingers very spread.
        	With multiple dimensions, PCA is very useful since it's hard to see through a cloud of data.
